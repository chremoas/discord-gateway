# discord-gateway

Discord proxy/gateway so that a command does not need to know exactly how to talk to discord.

As more and more command spawn for the chremoas bot, the need to potentially rate limit calls to discord increases.  This gateway will provide that functionality all while also hopefully simplifying some of the things one might do with objects in discord.
